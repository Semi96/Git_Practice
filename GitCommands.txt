GIT WORK FLOW GUIDE:

	git branch <branchName>			create local branch
	git checkout <branchName>   		checkout the branch. (now we are working on this branch)
	git status				check modifications you've made as well as branch status
	git add -A				stage changes
	git commit				commit changes (git commit -m 'message here')
	Esc + i to begin writing comments	: + wq to complete commit
	git push -u origin <branchName>		Push branchName to remote repository

(Typically someone will review the branch and the changes i submitted now. If all is good, merge branch with master) 

	git checkout master			First, 'switch' to master branch
	git pull origin master			Pull down any changes made so our local master branch is up to date with remote master
	git merge <branchName>			Merge this with branchName
	git push origin master			Push these changes


ADDITIONAL:

	git branch -a				See all branches (local & remote) and which one you're on
	git branch --merged			See branches we've merged so far
	git branch -d <branchName>		Delete local branch
	git push origin --delete <branchName>	Delete remote branch (RARELY do this)
